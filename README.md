# Vrat

This project is an early learning project created for personal experimentation with Python and Discord bots. 

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to explore:

- Python scripting and automation
- Discord bot commands and event handling
- Basic networking and system information gathering

## Disclaimer

This code is **for educational purposes only**. It is not intended for use on computers or networks without explicit permission. Using it on machines without authorization may be illegal and is strongly discouraged.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `discord.py` library
- A Discord bot token with appropriate permissions

## Usage

Use this project only in controlled, safe environments (such as your own machine or a virtual machine for testing). Review all code before running, and ensure you understand what each part does.

## Notes

- Designed purely for learning Python and Discord bot concepts.
- Includes examples of subprocess handling, directory navigation, and session info gathering.
- Any resemblance to remote administration tools is purely incidental and for personal learning purposes.
